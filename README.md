黑料正能量永久-黑料正能量导航so　　换成我的表白，好的译作乃是作家之作和翻译之译的天作之合。即作家体裁和翻译体裁两相融洽的产品。融洽得好，井水不犯河水；要不，两全其美。
　　幡然我明白了许多——父亲想通过这个揭示生命的意义的故事，告诉我做事不要依赖别人，而是要自己来解决。就像蛾一样，要靠自己的力量破茧而出，才能飞翔，才能冲向那广阔美丽的蓝天；反之依赖别人帮助自己出来却永远飞不起来，等待的却是灭亡。这是一个多么寓意深刻的故事啊。从一只小小的蛾子身上让我看到了生命的真谛，人生成长的要义。从而我也明白了父亲对我长期以来那沉默的希冀；他希望我的人生之路要由自己来主宰，不要成为别人的主宰。生命的意义在于奋斗、拼搏。只有真正经历过这些，人才能成为真正完善的人，拥有一个完美的人生。
